# Peek Here

![demo](https://github.com/ctf0/laravel-goto-controller/assets/7388088/7fce72a9-25e1-4d61-a6e8-76b41a215784)

open a peek panel at current line, kinda like having a picture in picture inside your editor, or sorted bookmarks where you can jump in between from the same place.

## Usage

- `Peek: Current`: show peek panel at current line
- `Peek: Save Line`: add current line to peek-able locations
- `Peek: Clear Saved Line`: clear previously saved locations

## Notes

recommended to set `"editor.stablePeek": true,` to avoid closing the peek if u want to make any changes.
